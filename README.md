# Moneys

:construction: BE AWARE: Moneys is still on development, things may be unstable. Contributions are appreciated. :construction:

## Installing
```
git clone git@github.com:lenilsonjr/moneys.git
cd moneys
bundle install
```
After that, copy config/database-example.yml, rename it database.yml and setup your database access. This version uses PostgreSQL.
Then you can run `rake dev:setup`.

Have fun!
